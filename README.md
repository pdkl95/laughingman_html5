==============================

Just a fun little project I did after getting inspired
by [CSSWarp](http://csswarp.eleqtriq.com/).

The animation of the letters is 100% CSS, and javascript is only
used to draw on the canvas for the face. I might change that
part to SVG in the future, to be completely free of javascript.
